# MCPY
Minecraft, but made in Python 3 and pyglet.


To run, install pyglet and Python 3.
Go the the project's directory and run minecraft.py with Python 3.

Or run the compiled binaries in the releases page. No Mac binary because I don't give my weekly paycheck to Apple. 
If you want to compile one for the project, contact me.

# Building
To compile, install the PyInstaller Python module.
Then, go to the file directory.
Run `python3 -m PyInstaller --onefile ./minecraft.py ./noise_gen.py`
